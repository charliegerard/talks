#### In a nutshell

Creative Technologies are amazing and experimenting with them has the potential to open your mind to what is possible and help you solve problems in innovate ways.

Often first used in Art installations, these technologies are also moving towards real life applications and experimenting with them is essential for two main reasons:
	* As the technology field is moving fast, these technologies will be everywhere in a few years and learning to use them now allows you to stay up to date.
	* Experimentation allows you to push the boundaries to what you thought was possible.
